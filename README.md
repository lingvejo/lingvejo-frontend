### Why an Esperanto name?

Ah, you wonder, **why is this world called Lingvejo?** And why is its language spoken in tongues that do not belong to your land? The answer is simple yet profound.

Long ago, the **ancient wizards** of Lingvejo knew that to unify the world and its many inhabitants, they would need a language that transcended borders‚Äîa tongue capable of connecting hearts and minds from all corners of the universe. They chose **Esperanto**, a language born from unity and simplicity, a language with the power to cross all divides and bind all peoples together in common purpose.

But know this, young adventurer: Esperanto is but a starting point. A stepping stone. As you traverse this enchanted world, you will encounter more tongues, each with its own arcane power. Your mastery of language will be your most powerful weapon in the battles ahead.
